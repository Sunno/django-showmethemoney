Trying to make django payments easier... by the 
minute.

As of right now this is a django-subscription rewrite 
trying to make it not depend on django-paypal.


As of right now this requires:
- Leftfield/django-subscription which removes django 
paypal dependendency

If you want to use paypal as your payment backend you 
will need:
- dcramer/django-paypal

I have also forked that repository to add some of the 
pull requests. You can find my version at 
scast/django-paypal.

Just in case, this is not ready for production yet.
